# Cyber-Security-Analytics-Projects
These were some of my noteworthy projects related to my time within Mohawk College's Cyber Secruity Analytics graduate certificate program
### Disclaimer
The projects listed are ones I am specifically proud of, however there are projects I excluded for the sake of maintaining the integrity of the assignments created by my professors. My goal is to show off as much as my work as I can without exposing answers and outlines to potential projects within future semesters of the program. Obviously for any future students who found this, it is up to you if you would like to use my works as proper references, but I will not remain idle should I be informed of any plagarism of my work. For any professionals and employers within the industry interested in seeing more of my work that was not included here, you may inquire with me further. Notably I have work related to some mock hacking attempts and experience within a tabletop exercise that I have not posted here.
